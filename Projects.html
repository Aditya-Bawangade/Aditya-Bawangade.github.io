<p><b>Building a Stock Exchange</b><br />
<!-- <a href="https://sitar-sim.github.io/sitar/">[Project Webpage]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; -->
<a href="https://github.com/tyagibhavya/LLPETM">[Project GitHub Repo]</a><br /></p>
<p><p>Welcome to the Low Latency Electronic Trading Machine repository! This project is dedicated to the development of high-performance trading entities, matchmaking and liquidity algorithms, and advanced low-level optimization techniques in C++20. The system is designed to handle electronic trading with a focus on low latency and efficient execution. This is a learning project and is based on a book by Sourav Ghosh.</p>
<p><strong>Framework</strong></p>
<p>The project is built on a robust framework that supports the following key components:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Network Operations: Structured to support TCP and UDP network socket operations for efficient communication.</li>
    <li>Multithreading: Utilizes multithreading for concurrent execution, enhancing overall system performance.</li>
    <li>Market-Level Components: Implements market-level components for low latency, ensuring quick response times.</li>
    <li>Position Tracking: Keeps track of trading positions to provide valuable insights into the market.</li>
    <li>Profit and Loss Calculation: Calculates profits and losses to aid in strategic decision-making.</li>
    <li>Risk Management: Manages risk by implementing effective risk management strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Operational Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>To enhance operational effectiveness, the following optimizations have been applied:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Performance Evaluation System: A tailored system has been deployed to evaluate performance. It incorporates timestamps on market events for precise measurement.</li>
    <li>Thread Affinities: Thread affinities have been assigned to optimize the utilization of CPU resources.</li>
    <li>Reduced Logging: Logging has been optimized to reduce overhead and improve overall system efficiency.</li>

<h3>MARN OS â€“ Interrupt Handling in an Operating System using Assembly and C</h3>
<p><b>Course Project under the Guidance of Prof. Shitala Prasad</b><br />
<!-- <a href="https://sitar-sim.github.io/sitar/">[Project Webpage]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; -->
<a href="https://github.com/Aditya-Bawangade/MARN-OS-">[Project GitHub Repo]</a><br /></p>
<p><p><strong>MARN OS</strong> is a learning operating system project developed using Assembly and C for Intel x86 machines. This project emphasizes implementing interrupts and effective interrupt handling, expanding the capabilities of a foundational OS codebase.</p>

<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented interrupts and interrupt handling using assembly and C.</li>
    <li>Developed an Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) to manage various interrupts.</li>
    <li>Handled different types of interrupts, including software, hardware, and user-defined interrupts.</li>
    <li>Incorporated exception handling for scenarios such as division by zero and overflow errors.</li>
    <li>Implemented a Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) to manage hardware interrupts like Timer (IRQ0) and Keyboard (IRQ1).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Project Structure:</strong></p>
<p>The project is organized into several key components, including bootloader and kernel files, along with a directory for tools and scripts for building and running the OS.</p>

<p>To build the project, simply run the Makefile, and use the provided <code>run.sh</code> script to execute the operating system.</p>

<h3>3D Scanner using Arduino IDE</h3>
<p><b>Damn</b><br />
<!-- <a href="https://sitar-sim.github.io/sitar/">[Project Webpage]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; -->
<a href="https://github.com/Aditya-Bawangade/3D-IR-Scanner">[Project GitHub Repo]</a><br /></p>
<p><p><strong>3D IR Scanner using Arduino</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project focuses on building a 3D IR Scanner using Arduino Uno and Optical Infrared Sensors. The scanner efficiently acquires precise 3D point clouds for small objects, generating over 2500 points per scan. This low-cost, scalable solution integrates hardware and software for 3D scanning and visualization.</p>



<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High-Precision Scanning:</strong> The scanner collects 2500+ 3D points per scan, enabling detailed 3D point clouds of small objects.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Hardware Design:</strong> Built using 10+ components, including Optical IR Sensors, Stepper Motors, and Arduino Uno.</li>
    <li><strong>Motor Control:</strong> The stepper motors are fine-tuned for optimized object positioning based on predefined geometries, ensuring accurate and repeatable scans.</li>
    <li><strong>Portable & Cost-Effective:</strong> The scanner is designed to be easily replicable and cost-effective, making it accessible for hobbyists, researchers, and makers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Arduino Uno</li>
    <li>Optical Infrared Sensors</li>
    <li>Stepper Motors (for precise movement)</li>
    <li>Power Supply</li>
    <li>Various resistors, capacitors, and wiring (total of 10+ components)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Setup:</strong> The object is placed on the platform of the scanner.</li>
    <li><strong>Motor Movement:</strong> The Stepper Motors adjust the position of the object in small increments, based on a geometric scan path.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> The Optical Infrared Sensors collect distance data from multiple angles as the object moves, creating a 3D map of its surface.</li>
    <li><strong>Point Cloud Generation:</strong> The distance data is processed into a 3D point cloud with over 2500 points, accurately representing the object's shape.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Export:</strong> The collected data can be exported for further 3D processing or visualization, such as in 3D modeling software.</li>
</ul>
